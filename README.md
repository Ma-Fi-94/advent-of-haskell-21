# advent-of-haskell-21
Advent of Code 2021, solved in Haskell! Because I am nearly done with AoC 2022 and was a bit too busy for the remaining few '22 tasks.

Also trying to achieve sub-second runtime for every single day, because that nudges me to think more deeply about everything. Performance is measured after compiling with -O3 and executing five times on my system (Apple MacBook with M2 Max processor, 32 GB RAM.)
